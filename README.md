# Journey Together Capstone Project
### Here is my capstone project for the Savvy Coders 12 week Full Stack Web Developmet Program of 2021.
### Journey Together is an original idea I brought to life inspired by my very on weight loss journey. My goal is to create a safe space for people who need encouragement during their journey. People who do not feel comfortable going to the gym are able to workout in virutal workout rooms solo or they can meet people around the world on a similar journey. The site also has a social media portion where people can post their progress, share photos and give or receive enccouragement from others.
